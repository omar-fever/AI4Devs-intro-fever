As a software developer, using this template HTML
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>    
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

I want to add a function in the script.js that will reverse an input string
And in the HTML:
- add one text box input for a large set of characters (preferable visible in the viewport)
  - with rounded borders
- add one button with text "Reverse", that will pick the text input and execute the function in the script.js
- add another text box (read only) to show the output of the previous point
Also, all the items should be centered in the HTML page
